# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Learned
- Using factory functions to create reusable player objects  
- Applying the module pattern with IIFEs to encapsulate game logic and state  
- Handling DOM manipulation and event listeners  
- Implementing a modal for user input and an overlay for winner announcements  
- Adding basic CSS animations to improve user experience  

This project was built as part of my journey to practice JavaScript fundamentals.
